            <p>
                Synergy is a nonprofit organization dedicated to empowering students and transforming communities through STEM education. 
                Our goal is to bridge the gap between students from underserved backgrounds and the resources they need to thrive in science, 
                technology, engineering, and mathematics. By providing hands-on workshops, mentorship, and real-world projects, 
                Synergy helps students build the skills and confidence to become the innovators of tomorrow.

                        At Synergy, we believe that every student deserves the opportunity to explore their potential in STEM, regardless of their background or circumstances.

                        and develop creative solutions. By connecting skilled students with nonprofits, Synergy also facilitates meaningful contributions to the community,

                    <h2>About the Founder</h2>
                    <p>
                        Synergy was founded by Victoria Hong, a passionate advocate for STEM education and a dedicated mentor to young innovators. 
                        With a background in electrical and computer engineering, Victoria broke through barriers as a first-generation, low-income Vietnamese woman 
                        to pursue her own academic and professional success. Having experienced firsthand the transformative power of education, 
                        she established Synergy to create more opportunities for students from underrepresented communities to engage with STEM in a meaningful way.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Victoria's vision for Synergy stems from her belief in the potential of every student to become a leader and problem solver. 
                        Through her leadership, Synergy is committed to nurturing that potential by providing the resources, mentorship, and real-world experiences students need to succeed.
