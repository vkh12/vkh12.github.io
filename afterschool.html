            <h2>The Challenge</h2> 
            <p>
              Virtual Vendors is an online platform designed to empower street vendors and small business owners by 
              helping them quickly set up digital storefronts. Many vendors, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, 
              lacked the technical knowledge or resources to transition their businesses online. 
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-lg-6">
            <h2>The Solution</h2> 
            <p>
              The goal of the platform was to provide an intuitive, easy-to-use solution that enabled 
              vendors to manage their inventory, interact with customers, and increase sales digitally—all within 
              the constraints of a 24-hour hackathon.

          <h1>Understanding the Problem</h1>
          <h2>Background</h2>
          <p>
            Each semester, universities like Rutgers host Involvement Fairs for students to explore organizations. However, with over 800 
            organizations available and each using its own platform for communication (like GroupMe, Discord, and Instagram), students find 
            it challenging to stay informed. This issue became worse during the pandemic when many activities went virtual, leading to a loss of engagement.
          </p>
          <h2>Motivation</h2>
          <p>
            Students and coordinators use various communication tools—Google Classroom, Slack, Discord, GroupMe, Zoom—causing confusion and 
            inefficiencies. Important information often gets lost across different platforms, and managing multiple organizations becomes overwhelming. 
            There was a clear need for a unified platform to streamline communication and organization management.

          <h1>Design Process</h1>
          <div>
            <h2>Empathize & Define</h2>
            <p>To understand the needs of students, I conducted a survey and interviews with 10 current college students and recent graduates.
            </p>

                  <h3>Key Findings</h3>
                  <ul>
                    <li><b>100% </b>of participants used social media (GroupMe, Facebook, etc.) to communicate with organizations.</li>
                    <li><b>50% </b>relied solely on email.</li>
                    <li><b>90% </b>learned about clubs through word-of-mouth.</li>
                    <li><b>55% </b>discovered opportunities via social media and email.</li>
                  </ul>
                </div>
                <div class="col-lg-6">
                  <h3>Pain Points</h3>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Poor communication from organization coordinators, especially in larger groups.</li>
                    <li>Lack of consistent promotion of events and opportunities.</li>
                    <li>Difficulty in managing multiple platforms for communication.</li>

                <div class="col-lg-12">
                  <h2>User Personas</h2>
                  <p>
                    To ensure the app catered to diverse student needs, I created three key personas:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><b>Jasmine</b>, 18, a Rutgers freshman on the pre-med track, who struggles with the virtual transition and wants to meet new people.</li>
                    <li><b>Eric</b>, 21, a senior in Computer Science and a club coordinator who seeks a streamlined way to coordinate meetings and share information with members.</li>
                    <li><b>Jessica</b>, 20, a junior who started college during the pandemic and finds it difficult to discover clubs and events.</li>
                  </ul>
                </div>
              </div>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h2>Ideation: Translating User Insights into Features</h2>
            <p>
              The ideation process began after synthesizing insights from user research. Based on the key pain points and needs identified, I brainstormed a 
              set of core features that would address the challenges faced by students and organization leaders.
            </p>
            <h3><b>Key Priorities</b></h3>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Centralized communication: </b>
                A space where students can easily communicate with organizations and receive updates in one place.
              </li>
              <li><b>Event discovery: </b>
                An intuitive search feature where students can explore organizations and upcoming events based on their interests.
              </li>
              <li><b>Task management: </b>
                A system to help students track and complete tasks assigned within organizations, reducing the complexity of managing responsibilities.
              </li>
              <li><b>Personalized dashboard:</b>
                A quick-access hub where students can view their memberships, tasks, and upcoming events, promoting ease of use.              
              </li>
              <li><b>Profile creation: </b>
                A feature for students to create personal profiles, showcasing their interests and organization affiliations for more tailored connections.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              The ideation process was visualized using mind maps and user flows to outline how these features would work together to form a cohesive app. 
              I drew inspiration from productivity tools like Trello for task management and social platforms like LinkedIn and Facebook for community engagement. 
              My goal was to integrate the social, organizational, and management aspects seamlessly.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h2>Wireframing: Structuring the User Experience</h2>
            <p>
              With a clear idea of the app’s core features, I proceeded to the wireframing phase, where I laid out the structure and flow of the user experience. 
              Wireframes helped me visualize how each feature would be organized, ensuring ease of navigation and prioritizing essential user actions.
            </p>
            <div>
              <h3><b>Low-Fidelity Wireframes</b></h3>
              <ul>
                <li><b>Objective: </b>
                  Capture the basic layout, hierarchy, and structure of key screens.
                </li>
                <li><b>Key Screens Wireframed: </b>
                </li>
                <ul>
                  <li>Onboarding/Greeting Page</li>
                  <li>Dashboard</li>
                  <li>Explore Tab</li>
                  <li>Task Page</li>
                  <li>Profile Page</li>
                </ul>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h3><b>Mid-Fidelity Wireframes</b></h3>
              <p>
                After validating the low-fidelity wireframes through peer feedback, I moved to mid-fidelity wireframes, introducing 
                more detailed elements like icons, navigation patterns, and placeholder content.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li><b>Objective: </b>
                  Test how well the layout supports user goals and ensure information is intuitively presented.
                </li>
                <li><b>Enhancements Made: </b>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Adjusted navigation menus to make them more prominent.</li>
                    <li>Refined the hierarchy of information in the Dashboard, prioritizing tasks over less time-sensitive items like messages.</li>
                    <li>Streamlined the Explore tab by adding filter options to make searching for organizations more precise and user-friendly.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                At this stage, I began testing the wireframes with potential users, asking them to perform basic tasks like finding a specific 
                event or checking tasks. The feedback gathered was invaluable in fine-tuning the layout and ensuring an optimal user experience.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div></div>
              <h3><b>High-Fidelity Wireframes: Brining the Vision to Life</b></h3>
              <p>
                Once the wireframes were finalized and validated, I moved on to high-fidelity prototyping. This stage focused on visual design, 
                interaction details, and ensuring the final product felt polished and professional.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li><b>Objective: </b>

          <h1>Challenges & Solutions</h1>
          <p>Throughout the design and development process of the <i>AfterSchool</i> app, several challenges arose, requiring thoughtful solutions 
            to ensure the final product met user needs effectively.</p>
          <div>
            <h2>Challenge 1: Balancing Simplicity with Functionalitys</h2>
            <p>
              During the ideation phase, it became clear that packing too many features into the app risked overwhelming users. To address this, 
              I focused on prioritizing core features that students would find most valuable, such as task management, communication, and 
              event discovery. Additional features were strategically placed to be secondary, accessed only when needed. This balance maintained the 
              app’s usability without compromising its utility.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h2>Challenge 2: Creating a Unified Experience for Different User Types</h2>
            <p>
              The target users—students and organization leaders—had different needs. For students, ease of navigation and communication was critical, 
              while for organization leaders, managing events and tasks was a priority. By designing separate yet interconnected dashboards for each group, 
              I provided tailored functionality without fragmenting the overall experience.
          </div>
          <div>
            <h2>Challenge 3: Maintaining Engagement and User Retention</h2>
            <p>
              To foster ongoing engagement, I incorporated gamification elements such as progress bars for task completion and notifications for upcoming events. 
              This approach created a sense of achievement and urgency, encouraging students to regularly check the app and remain active in their organizations.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="container algin-items-center">
        <div class="col-lg-12">
          <h1>Results</h1>
          <p>
            The project resulted in a fully functioning high-fidelity prototype for <i>AfterSchool</i>, with positive outcomes validated 
            through usability testing and feedback.          
          </p>
          <div>
            <h2>Outcomes</h2>
            <p>
              The AfterSchool app successfully met user needs through a clean, user-centered design that improved task management, 
              event discovery, and communication for students and organization leaders. Early usability tests showed increased productivity 
              and engagement as students could better organize their extracurricular activities in one central app. The app’s intuitive 
              interface for task assignment and event creation also streamlined workflows for leaders. The prototype's success generated 
              interest from university stakeholders, leading to plans for further development and potential funding to move toward an MVP phase.

            <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
            <ul>
              <li><b>User Research Drives Success: </b>
                Conducting in-depth interviews and focus groups early in the process ensured that the final design aligned with user 
                needs, reducing the need for significant rework.              
              </li>
              <li><b>Iterative Design is Crucial: </b>
                The project benefited immensely from multiple rounds of wireframing and prototyping. Testing both low- and high-fidelity 
                wireframes allowed me to catch usability issues early, leading to a smoother final design process.              
              </li>
              <li><b>Balancing Features is Key: </b>
                Avoiding feature bloat by prioritizing core functionality kept the app simple yet effective. It’s important to resist 
                the temptation to over-complicate the user experience, even if additional features may seem beneficial.

          <h1>Conclusion</h1>
          <p>
            <i>AfterSchool</i> provided a comprehensive solution to the challenges faced by students managing their extracurricular activities. 
            By focusing on user-centered design principles, I was able to create an intuitive, functional app that simplified communication, task management, 
            and event discovery for both students and organization leaders. The iterative design process, informed by user feedback, led to a polished, 
            high-fidelity prototype that is ready for potential development.
            <br><br>
            This project was an invaluable learning experience, demonstrating the importance of thorough research, collaborative feedback, and 
            iterative design in creating digital products that make a meaningful impact on users' lives. Looking forward, I am excited to see how the 
            app evolves into a functional product that empowers students to stay organized, engaged, and connected within their academic communities.
