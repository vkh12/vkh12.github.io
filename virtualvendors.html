          <h2>About the Project</h2>
          <p>
            The concept for <i>Virtual Vendors</i> was developed during HackHERS, a 24-hour, women-centric 
            hackathon hosted annually by <i>Rutgers Women in Computer Science</i>. My design earned both the <b>Best 
            FinTech Award</b>, sponsored by <i>Fiserv</i>, and <b>Best UI/UX Award</b> for its innovative approach and seamless 
            user experience.

            <h2>The Challenge</h2> 
            <p>
              Many street vendors, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic, faced significant barriers 
              in transitioning their businesses online due to a lack of technical knowledge and resources. 
              This digital divide left them struggling to adapt and sustain their livelihoods in an 
              increasingly virtual marketplace.

          <div class="col-lg-6">
            <h2>The Solution</h2> 
            <p>
              Virtual Vendors is an online platform designed to empower street vendors and small business owners by 
              helping them quickly set up digital storefronts. The goal of the platform is to provide an intuitive, 
              easy-to-use solution that enable vendors to manage their inventory, interact with customers, and 
              increase sales.

          <h1>Problem Statement</h1>
          <p>
            Street vendors often face challenges when transitioning to digital commerce due to the complexity of existing platforms. 
            Many vendors rely solely on mobile devices and lack the time or resources to create and manage online stores effectively. 
            The goal was to design a user-friendly, mobile-first platform that enables vendors to set up a storefront in minutes while 
            customers can discover local vendors quickly.
          </p>
          <h2>Key Insights</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>No Commission-Free Platforms</b>: There are currently no commission-free food delivery platforms, leaving vendors with limited options to sell their products online without high fees.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Underutilized Potential</b>: Despite their importance, street vendors are often underutilized due to a lack of promotion and effective marketing for their goods, limiting their reach and growth potential.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Scale of Street Vending</b>: With 56,488 street vendors in the U.S. and over a billion globally, they represent a significant part of the urban economy. In New York City alone, there are approximately 20,000 vendors.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Economic Importances</b>: Street vendors are an integral part of urban economies and play a crucial role in the labor force, especially in developing countries.
              </li>
            </ul>

          <h1>Design Process</h1>
          <div>
            <h2>Empathize & Define</h2>
            <p>
              Given the 24-hour timeframe, I relied on secondary research and competitive analysis to understand street vendors' needs. 
            </p>
            <div>
              <div class="row">
                <div class="col-lg-6">
                  <h3>General Theme</h3>
                  <p>Vendors need an easy-to-use platform that works on mobile devices, requires minimal technical knowledge, and integrates 
                    geolocation for finding vendors in real time.
                  </p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-lg-6">
                  <h3>App Requirements</h3>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Mobile optimization is crucial, as many vendors operate solely on smartphones.</li>
                    <li>Streamlining the onboarding process and simplifying product uploads would be key to adoption.</li>
                    <li>Geolocation and direct communication tools could increase customer engagement.</li>
                  </ul>

          <div>
            <h2>Ideation & Wireframing</h2>
            <p>
              Based on this research, I began sketching out low-fidelity wireframes in Figma. My primary focus was ensuring the 
              platform's ease of use while keeping the design minimal to fit the needs of street vendors.
            </p>
            <h3><b>User Flow Priorities</b></h3>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Streamlined Onboarding: </b>
                A quick, three-step process to set up a storefront, making it possible for 
                street vendors to get their products online within 10 minutes.
              </li>
              <li><b>Mobile-First Design: </b>
                Since most street vendors primarily use smartphones, the platform was designed to be fully responsive, 
                ensuring a seamless experience on mobile devices.
              </li>
              <li><b>Geolocation Features: </b>
                Incorporating map-based functionalities to help customers locate street vendors nearby.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>I started by sketching out low-fidelity wireframes using Figma, focusing on keeping the layout clean and intuitive. 
              After receiving feedback from friends and family, I rapidly iterated on the wireframes and created high-fidelity 
              mockups.

            <div>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>Locate Vendors (Geolocation Feature)</b>: Customers can view a map to locate vendors near their location in real-time. Vendors can update their location 
                  as they move, ensuring customers can find them with ease.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Explore & Support Vendors</b>: Customers can explore trending and upcoming vendor events, providing visibility to vendors. This functionality helps connect vendors with 
                  community events where they can gain more exposure.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Vendor Profiles & Product Listings</b>: Vendors can create a profile, upload products, and update inventory seamlessly. The platform is designed to accommodate product images and 
                  descriptions, making it easy for vendors to showcase their offerings.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Direct Communication (Chat Functionality)</b>: Customers can directly communicate with vendors using the built-in messaging system. This feature helps with custom orders, delivery
                  coordination, and answering product-related queries.

          <div>
            <h2>Challenge 1: Time Constraints</h2>
            <p>
              Given the 24-hour limit, I focused on delivering a functional MVP. I prioritized features that would have the most significant 
              impact for vendors, including geolocation, profile creation, and direct messaging.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h2>Challenge 2: Mobile Optimization</h2>
            <p>
              The app had to work flawlessly on mobile devices, as many vendors rely on smartphones for business. I designed the app 
              with mobile responsiveness in mind, ensuring an optimal user experience on both mobile and desktop.
          </div>
          <div>
            <h2>Challenge 3: Mobile-First Design</h2>
            <p>
              Without the time to conduct formal interviews, I relied on secondary research and competitive analysis to inform the design. 
              By understanding the pain points of existing platforms, I was able to focus on simplifying key workflows like product uploads 
              and customer communication.
